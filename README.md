# Computational Mathematics

This repository contains implementations of computational mathematics algorithms, developed for the Computational Mathematics course at UEM (State University of Maring√°). The repository includes solutions to problems in precision, optimization, linear algebra, and differential equations.

### Running opt precision:

In the terminal, set execute permission for the shell script.

```bash 
chmod +x scripts/plot.sh
```

Then, run it with the following command:

```bash
./scripts/plot.sh
